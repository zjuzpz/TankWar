# TankWar
This is a Java project TankWar.<br>
I just uploaded the 2.2 version which added pictures for tanks and explodes.<br>
I used OO concept to delevop this project, thus it is easily to add more features(classes) into the project.<br>
If you want to do the similar or the same project for practice, I recommend you have the knowledge of the following concepts: <br>
OO programming, GUI based on awt or swing, double buffering for diminishing flicker, keyboard control.<br>
If you have any suggestion or questions, please contact me at zjuzpz@gmail.com.<br>
Thanks!
